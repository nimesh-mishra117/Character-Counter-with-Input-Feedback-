This repository contains an advanced implementation of a character counter 
designed to enhance user experience while typing in a textarea. The application 
tracks the number of characters entered, providing real-time feedback on the 
total count and the remaining characters allowed, with a limit set to 100 
characters. 

In addition to the basic character count, this project categorizes the input into 
letters, digits, and special characters, offering detailed insights into the user's 
typing. The interface features dynamic visual feedback, where the remaining 
character count changes color based on the user's input, indicating whether they are within the limit or have exceeded it.The application is built using HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript, showcasing responsive design principles and user-friendly 
elements. This project serves as an excellent example for developers looking to 
implement interactive text input features in their web applications.
